    "\n",
    "This layer cleans the raw data by applying type casting and basic filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also apply multiple **data quality expectations** to ensure the data integrity before it flows downstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of Expectations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EXPECT NOT NULL(SalesOrderNumber)`  \n",
    "  Ensures every row has a sales order number. Null values here would invalidate the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EXPECT UNIQUE(SalesOrderNumber)`  \n",
    "  Guarantees uniqueness of sales orders, avoiding duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EXPECT NOT NULL(OrderDate)`  \n",
    "  Order date is mandatory to analyze sales over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EXPECT(OrderDate <= CURRENT_DATE())`  \n",
    "  Prevents future dates which are invalid in historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EXPECT(Quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 100)`  \n",
    "  Ensures quantity is within reasonable bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EXPECT(UnitPrice > 0)`  \n",
    "  Unit price must be positive, no free or negative prices allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EXPECT(TaxAmount >= 0)`  \n",
    "  Tax amount cannot be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `EXPECT EmailAddress LIKE '%@%'`  \n",
    "  Basic check to ensure email address has an '@' symbol (simple email format validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "These expectations act as guardrails. If any fail during pipeline runs, alerts or failures are triggered, helping maintain clean and reliable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **constraint clause** is a SQL conditional statement that must evaluate to true or false for each record. The constraint contains the actual logic for what is being validated. When a record fails this condition, the expectation is triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints must use valid SQL syntax and cannot contain the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom Python functions\n",
    "- External service calls\n",
    "- Subqueries referencing other tables\n",
